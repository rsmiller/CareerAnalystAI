# Career Analyst AI

This is a simple example of leveraging Angular or React, C#, SignarR, and OpenAI to build a tailored AI chatbot. In this example, this chatbot is tailored to be a career analyst and give detailed, no-BS information when prompted about a career. 
## Frontend
This is built in Angular and connects to SignalR on localhostâ€”a super simple page with limited styling. The data comes back fine, but needs some refinement through specific formatting from OpenAI/LLMs markdown. The React project has a component for this.

## Backend
C# API that acts as a middleman to communicate with OpenAI and stream tokens to the frontend when it is called.
